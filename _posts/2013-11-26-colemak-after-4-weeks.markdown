title: Colemak after 4 weeks
teaser: Experiences of learning colemak after 4 weeks of learning
---

A while back I read about Colemak in an article on hn. Up until then the only
alternative layout I knew, which is actually being used, was Dvorak.

At the time me and my mates practised typing because we were intimidated by
the typing speed of most people in screencasts. I never really learned ten
finger typing, thus I developed my own weird system of seven to eight fingers.

My speed was around 70wpm, when I concluded that not using the regular ten 
finger typing was keeping me from improving my speed, so I decided to actually
learn it and as an additional challenge I combined it with learning Colemak.
The idea was when using a new layout and ten finger typing I won't fall back
into habits as much as if I had just tried to switch to ten finger typing as
stick with qwerty.

The fact of how qwerty originated also made me want to learn an alernate
layout. For those who don't know, qwerty was created for typewriters and the
layout was chosen so it won't get stuck if you type fast. As a side effect it
also created sort of a maximum speed at which one can type. Alternative layouts
have been designed in a way to enable the user to have either the most speed
or better ergonomics than qwerty.

Even though Dvorak has been designed to type as fast as possible I decided to
learn Colemak since it is being praised for its ergonomics and most users
also surpass people using qwerty in terms of speed.

###Week #1 + #2

The first few days were exhausting especially since I was trying to keep my
GitHub streak up. I used Klavaro for practising since it supports Colemak and
runs on ubuntu. Completing the first 31 lessons wasn't all too exciting, it 
took me about three days to complete them. After that practising was the only
way to improve in speed and after the first week, even though continuously 
swearing since colemak did still feel a bit unnatural, my speed was around 
20wpm. The next week I still practised daily and my speed wend up to around
35wpm.

###Week #3

With 35wpm working on code didn't feel as painful anymore as it did in the
first week, but I wanted to keep my pace of improving up. I thought about how
I study for exams and that's how I came up with, what I felt the most helpful
method I used in learning Colemak. When studying I spend the last hour before
going to sleep with reading through my notes or practising problems in math for
example. That way you process what you read in your sleep and it burns into
your brain. Adepting it to my learning process helped a lot and I got up to
around 48wpm at the end of week three, although I sometimes thought I was going
insane as I sometimes thought about typing when doing something completely
different. It still felt pretty good having improved up to that speed.

###Week #4

The fourth didn't start off as well as I would have wanted it to, since I
barely had any time to practise and when I did I was getting worse results than
the week before. Then I took a whole day to practise and I was back in the
game. At the end of week four my speed was around 53wpm, which is exceptable
to work with.

###Conclusion

Overall I am very happy with my decision, it feels very smooth to type on
Colemak. I feared that I won't be able to use vim anymore when switching to
Colemak, but it actually helped me to get rid of using hjkl to move in a file,
which I know is a bad habit but I've been using vim for about four months now
and I learn something new every day so I can't get rid of every bad habit right
away.

I am not really a writer person but since I have been confident with using it
since about mid of week three I can't stop writing and I start to enjoy it more
and more.

All in all my opinion: It was a good choice to learn Colemak while learning ten
finger typing, because I when my results were still so low that it was
depressing I could always blame it on one or the other thing.

Not gonna lie it was not easy but definitely worth it.
